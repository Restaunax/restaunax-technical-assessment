# Restaunax Full-Stack Developer Technical Assessment

Welcome to the Restaunax Technical Assessment! üçïüöÄ

Thank you for your interest in joining our team at Restaunax. This assessment is designed to evaluate your full-stack development skills within the context of our restaurant management platform. We're interested in seeing how you approach problems, structure your code, and create solutions that address real-world scenarios in the restaurant technology space.

## The Scenario

As a developer at Restaunax, one of your tasks is to develop a critical component of our restaurant management system: a **Real-time Order Management Dashboard**. Restaurant owners need a simple yet effective way to monitor incoming orders, update their status, and manage their kitchen operations efficiently.

## Your Task

You are free to use any backend language or framework, though we recommend using technologies aligned with our stack (Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma). For the frontend, you **must use React with Material UI**.

### 1. Backend

Build a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

- `GET /orders` ‚Äî List all orders with pagination and filtering
- `GET /orders/:id` ‚Äî Retrieve a specific order with details
- `PATCH /orders/:id` ‚Äî Update order status and preparation notes
- `POST /orders` ‚Äî Create a new order (primarily for testing purposes)

Each order should include:

| Field            | Type                                                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id               | string or int                                                                    |
| customerName     | string                                                                           |
| customerEmail    | string                                                                           |
| orderType        | "delivery" \| "pickup"                                                           |
| items            | array of order items                                                             |
| status           | "pending" \| "confirmed" \| "preparing" \| "ready" \| "delivered" \| "completed" |
| total            | number                                                                           |
| createdAt        | ISO string                                                                       |
| scheduledFor     | ISO string (optional)                                                            |
| preparationNotes | string                                                                           |

Each order item should include:

| Field               | Type              |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| id                  | string or int     |
| name                | string            |
| quantity            | number            |
| price               | number            |
| specialInstructions | string (optional) |

### 2. Frontend

Create a responsive UI using **React and Material UI components** that includes:

- Dashboard overview showing orders by status
- Order detail view to see and update order information
- Filter/search functionality (by status, customer name, order type)
- Status management with drag-and-drop or dropdown functionality
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile viewports

### 3. Data Seeding (Required)

- **Create a seed script** that generates and inserts a substantial set of mock order data (at least 30-50 orders) with various statuses, order types, and creation dates
- The script should be well-documented and easy to run
- Include a variety of scenarios (orders with multiple items, special instructions, scheduled orders, etc.)
- This seed data will be essential for testing your API endpoints and frontend functionality
